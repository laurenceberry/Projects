      intro: "Digital product designer and web developer"
      bio_1: >
        Hi, I’m Laurence, a designer who writes code. I love tech, science and cities.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I’ve worked in diverse teams on both web development and user experience projects.
        I think a lot about accessibility, research driven design and development and
        I think it's important to really understand users needs to develop useful prototypes
        and digital services.

      bio_2: >
        I've been developing Ruby on Rails web apps since 2013 and am used to working within agile teams
        practicing behaviour driven development.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        My background is %{href} and a desire to use design to positively affect people’s lives
        lead me to working on digital services and products. I’m confident conducting user research
        and have experience running user testing sessions. I’m used to journey mapping, wireframing,
        creating quick mockups and communicating these ideas to the team and stakeholders through to
        development.


      bio_3: >
        I developed a keenness for learning new technologies during an interactive media and games design course where I
        got to grips with tools like Maya, the Adobe suite, photography and games engines early on.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        During my graphic design degree I explored some traditional techniques like screen
        printing and letterpress printing. I took a postgraduate course in communication design where I became facinated with conceptual
        studio work from Superstudio, Dunne & Raby and Superflux Labs and learned that you can use design as research,
        put an artefact out in to the real world and see how people interact with it or how it can change behaviours.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I have spent the last few years at %{href} using design and digital
        to help solve some of the tough problems faced in governments around adult social care. I don’t sit
        still much and love to get involved in hacks and rapid prototyping and have worked as part of
        Rewired State with clients including The Cabinet Office, IBM, Wired, Conde Nast, Goodyear, Wimbledon and more
        recently as part of Digiotology at the Emergency Medicine Conference.
