      intro: "Digital product designer and web developer"
      bio_1: >
        Hi, I'm a designer in government. I love tech, science and cities.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I work on web development and interaction design projects.
        I think a lot about accessibility, research driven design and development
        it's important to really understand users needs to develop useful prototypes
        and digital services.

      bio_2: >
        I've been developing Ruby on Rails web apps since 2013 and am used to working within agile teams.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        My background is %{href} a need to use design to positively affect people’s lives
        lead me to working on public digital services and products.

      bio_3: >
        I got hooked on interesting technologies during an interactive media and games design course where I
        was given free reign to play with tools like Maya, photography and games engines early on.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        During my graphic design degree I explored some traditional techniques like screen
        printing and letterpress printing. I took a postgraduate course in communication design where I became facinated with conceptual
        studio work from Superstudio, Dunne & Raby and Superflux Labs and learned that you can use design as research,
        put an artefact out in to the real world and see how people interact with it or how it can change behaviours.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I have spent the last few years at %{href} using design and digital
        to help solve some of the tough problems faced in governments around adult social care. I don’t sit
        still much and love to get involved in hacks and rapid prototyping and have worked with
        Rewired State and Rebel Labs with clients including The Cabinet Office, IBM, Wired, Conde Nast, Goodyear, Wimbledon.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I'm now working as a designer in government at the Government Digital Service.
